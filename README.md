# WallBallBounce
This is just a very simple "game" I made in SDL2 with C++

Its just like those old screen savers, but with a ball bouncing around the screen

If you decide to use this, remember to add a png with the same name as the texture gets in the game.cpp file, or change the file that gets loaded in the game.cpp constructor
